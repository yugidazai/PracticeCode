***Assessment requirement
- Display a ListView of items whose data can be retrieved from API
  https://www.whatsbeef.net/wabz/guide.php?start=0 (offset = 0)
- Each valid API (with any offset value) returns a JSON string with 10 items
  and the count value for the number of total existing items.
- When user scrolls down the ListView, more items should be loaded.

***Implementation
- Use a ListView with custom adapter to display list of ProgramEntry items.
  Items' data is loaded by using an implementation of AsyncTask to download JSON string from URL (with offset)
  then parse this JSON string to a list of a block of items.
  At the beginning, first 20 items are loaded with a progress dialog shown.
  When ListView is scrolled down to 2nd item of current block,
  next block of items which are not downloaded will be loaded by using above AsyncTask.
- JSONParserTest: JSONParser class's unit test.

***Development Environment
- IDE: Android Studio with JUnit4, Mockito and Hamcrest for UnitTest
- JDK jdk1.8.0_31 (jdk1.7.xxx is still compatible)
